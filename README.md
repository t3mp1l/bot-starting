# bot-starting
Hello, everyone. 
My name is Kirill. I have just started programming and decided to create my own account on GitHub as a kind of portfolio that should help me in the future.
I am now beginning to explore the world of programming using Python and trying to write some bots. I am starting my bot building with the aiogram framework. 
I am learning thanks to simple videos on YouTube. 
I will try to add to this repository, which marked the beginning of my journey, on a daily basis. I will try to be constantly active, create new projects, and implement them no matter what.
Have a good day.
